# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities via email to security@montreal.ai. Use encrypted channels when possible and provide a concise proof-of-concept along with impact assessment. We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide remediation timelines within five business days.

## Scope

All Solidity smart contracts, deployment scripts, and configuration files within this repository are in scope. Infrastructure supporting automated deployments (CI workflows, scripts) are also in scope.

## Handling

1. Confirm the report and establish a secure communication channel.
2. Reproduce the issue privately and develop a fix.
3. Coordinate disclosure timelines with the reporter.
4. Release patched versions and document mitigations.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and do not offer bug bounties at this time.
